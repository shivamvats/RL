# Rules

## Optimal Strategy

[1] If given a chance to play first, put a cross in a corner. If the opponent
plays a 'O' anywhere besides the center, it is bound to lose.
[2] If the opponent play a 'O' in the center, you need to wait for it to make a
mistake. If it continues to play correctly, a tie is guaranteed.
[3] If it places a 'O' in its first move, respond by playing the cross in
anoth
